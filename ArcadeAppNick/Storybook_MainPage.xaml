One morning, he set out on a quest to slay the evil dragon that had been terrorizing the nearby villages. Sir Gallant rode for many days through treacherous forests and across perilous mountains until he reached the dragon's lair, a dark cave on the side of a smoldering volcano. Gripping his sword tightly, Sir Gallant entered the cave. He walked slowly through the winding tunnels, the only light coming from scattered torches on the walls. Suddenly, he heard a thunderous roar up ahead. The dragon appeared, larger and more ferocious than Sir Gallant could have imagined..."

When he was close enough, he swung his sword with all his might. The blade bounced off the dragon's tough armored scales. Undeterred, Sir Gallant continued raining blows upon the dragon, searching for any weak points in its armor. The beast snarled and swiped at him with its razor sharp claws. Sir Gallant ducked behind a rock, narrowly avoiding being ripped to shreds. When the dragon reared back, he saw his chance and dove in, plunging his sword deep into the dragon's chest up to the hilt."
